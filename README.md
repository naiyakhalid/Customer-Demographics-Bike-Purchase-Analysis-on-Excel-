# Customer Demographics & Bike Purchase Analysis

## Project objective: 
This project explores the relationship between demographic factors and bike purchasing behavior using pivot tables and data visualizations. Key insights include the impact of marital status, income, age, education, and occupation on purchasing decisions. The analysis highlights how average age and income vary by marital status, helping identify target customer segments for marketing strategies.

## KPIs for Your Bike Sales Dashboard Project

1. Average Income per Bike Purchase
- Tracked by Gender and Marital Status
- Helps understand the spending power of buyers

2. Bike Purchase Rate by Age Bracket
- Age group contributing most to bike purchases (e.g., Middle Age)

3. Purchase Rate by Commute Distance
- Which commute range is associated with more bike buyers?
- Useful for identifying use cases (e.g., short-distance commuters)

4. Purchase Count by Education Level
- Helps identify the educational backgrounds of likely customers

5. Bike Purchases by Occupation
- Occupational segments more likely to purchase bikes

6. Bike Purchases by Region
- Identify which regions have the highest buyer density.

7. Gender-wise Purchase Analysis
- Count of bike purchases by Male vs. female.
- Helps in gender-targeted marketing

8. Income vs Purchase Trend
- Is higher income directly associated with purchases?
- For example, average income of buyers vs non-buyers

# Process:
- Verify data for any missing values and anomalies, and sort out the same.
- Made sure data is consistent and clean with respect to data type, data format and values used.
- Created an "Age Brackets" column to better visualize and categorize customers into different age groups (e.g., Adolescent, Middle Age, Old).
- Updated the "Marital Status" column by replacing 'M' with 'Married' and 'S' with 'Single' to improve clarity and avoid confusion.
- Corrected the "Gender" column by replacing 'M' with 'Male' and 'F' with 'Female' for consistency and readability.
- Created pivot tables according to the questions asked.
- Merge all pivot tables into one dashboard and apply slicer to make dynamic.

# Project Insights
# Gender vs. Income & Purchase:
- Males have a higher average income than females.
- Among both genders, those who purchased bikes had a slightly lower average income compared to those who didn’t.
  
# Age Brackets & Purchase Behavior:
- Middle-aged customers are the most frequent buyers of bikes.
- Very few purchases are seen in the adolescent and old age groups, suggesting age plays a key role in purchase decisions.

# Commute Distance Impact:
- Most bike purchases are by customers who commute 0–1 miles, indicating short-distance commuters are more likely to buy bikes.
- Purchase likelihood decreases with longer commute distances.

# Marital Status & Income/Age:
- Single customers are slightly younger and have a marginally lower income on average.
- Despite this, they show active participation in bike purchases.

# Education & Occupation Filters:
- The dashboard allows dynamic filtering by education, occupation, and region, enabling targeted insights for marketing and sales strategies.
