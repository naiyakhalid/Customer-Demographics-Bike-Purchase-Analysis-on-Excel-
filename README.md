# Coffee Sales-Purchase Analysis

## Project objective: 
This project explores the relationship between demographic factors and bike purchasing behavior using pivot tables and data visualizations. Key insights include the impact of marital status, income, age, education, and occupation on purchasing decisions. The analysis highlights how average age and income vary by marital status, helping identify target customer segments for marketing strategies.

## KPIs for Your Bike Sales Dashboard Project

__1. Average Income per Bike Purchase__ 
- Tracked by Gender and Marital Status
- Helps understand the spending power of buyers

__2. Bike Purchase Rate by Age Bracket__
- Age group contributing most to bike purchases (e.g., Middle Age)

__3. Purchase Rate by Commute Distance__
- Which commute range is associated with more bike buyers?
- Useful for identifying use cases (e.g., short-distance commuters)

__4. Purchase Count by Education Level__
- Helps identify the educational backgrounds of likely customers

__5. Bike Purchases by Occupation__
- Occupational segments more likely to purchase bikes

__6. Bike Purchases by Region__
- Identify which regions have the highest buyer density.

__7. Gender-wise Purchase Analysis__
- Count of bike purchases by Male vs. female.
- Helps in gender-targeted marketing

__8. Income vs Purchase Trend__
- Is higher income directly associated with purchases?
- For example, average income of buyers vs non-buyers

# Process:
- Verify data for any missing values and anomalies, and sort out the same.
- Made sure data is consistent and clean with respect to data type, data format and values used.
- Created an "Age Brackets" column to better visualize and categorize customers into different age groups (e.g., Adolescent, Middle Age, Old).
- Updated the "Marital Status" column by replacing 'M' with 'Married' and 'S' with 'Single' to improve clarity and avoid confusion.
- Corrected the "Gender" column by replacing 'M' with 'Male' and 'F' with 'Female' for consistency and readability.
- Created pivot tables according to the questions asked.
- Merge all pivot tables into one dashboard and apply slicer to make dynamic.

## Project Insights
__Gender vs. Income & Purchase__
- Males have a higher average income than females.
- Among both genders, those who purchased bikes had a slightly lower average income compared to those who didn’t.
  
__Age Brackets & Purchase Behavior__
- Middle-aged customers are the most frequent buyers of bikes.
- Very few purchases are seen in the adolescent and old age groups, suggesting age plays a key role in purchase decisions.

__Commute Distance Impact__
- Most bike purchases are by customers who commute 0–1 miles, indicating short-distance commuters are more likely to buy bikes.
- Purchase likelihood decreases with longer commute distances.

__Marital Status & Income/Age__
- Single customers are slightly younger and have a marginally lower income on average.
- Despite this, they show active participation in bike purchases.

__Education & Occupation Filters__
- The dashboard allows dynamic filtering by education, occupation, and region, enabling targeted insights for marketing and sales strategies.

## Conclusion
To improve bike sales, the company should focus on targeting middle-aged individuals, especially those with short commute distances (0–1 miles), as they are the most likely to purchase. Marketing efforts can be tailored by gender and income, offering affordable options to lower-income groups who still show high purchase interest. Additionally, exploring engagement strategies for underrepresented groups like adolescents and older adults may uncover untapped market potential.
